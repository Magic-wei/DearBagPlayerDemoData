# DearBagPlayer Demo Data Repo

This repo stores demo rosbag files for people to explore [DearBagPlayer](https://github.com/Magic-wei/DearBagPlayer).

## DearBagPlayer_Demo_Data.bag

This rosbag file is collected from car driving simulation (with exactly the same topic names in DearBagPlayer README GIF images). With this rosbag file, you can:
- normally select arbitrarily number of topics and just drag them to a subfigure to plot all of them (without holding any key)
- use "/vehicle_state/position/x" and "/vehicle_state/position/y" for XY plot (click them one by one, hold "Ctrl" key and drag them to a subfigure)
- use "/observer/s_length" as x-axis for data vs. travel distance plot (click this topic first, then another topic, hold "Shift" key and drag them to a subfigure)
- explore more features with other topics you like
